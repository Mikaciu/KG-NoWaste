# KG-NoWaste
Kittens Game - no waste !

## What does it do ?
The script will auto craft resources once certain parameters (either a percentage of the total resource pool, or a threshold) are met.
It's not meant to autoplay, *i.e.* auto build structures and upgrades. It only has been designed not to waste the game resources.

## How to use it ?
* Install the script either in GreaseMonkey (firefox) or in TamperMonkey (Chrome).
* Launch game, there should be some checkboxes on the right of the log pane
* Check what you want to automate
* Enjoy
